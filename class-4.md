Open tag <p> close </p>
My cat in html would be <p>my cat </p>
Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:
￼
Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things.

You can put elements inside other elements too , this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <strong> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
