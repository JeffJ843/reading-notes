Css
Css is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users and how they are styled and laid out etc.

Css syntax
CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."
The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:
h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}
We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.

Backgrounds and borders
example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and Borders module — you might think that it makes logical sense for the background-color and border-color properties to be defined in this module. And you'd be right.
